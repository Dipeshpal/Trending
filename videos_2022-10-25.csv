There’s always a beef going on in the market about android vs apple. Both android and iOS copy from each other but the reason to copy is fairly different. Android manufacturers always end up copying Apple and then criticising it for not making any innovation, which I believe is a little hypocritical. On the other side, apple copies android but not instantly it takes its time to make that feature perfect for their iPhone. But still, in the end, android ends up benefitting by copying Apple. So, we’ll decode the economics behind all of this. Enjoy!!

This is the 12th episode of NoNameSeries. The first story is about how android manufacturers always copy Apple and then criticise it for not making any innovation, which I believe is a little hypocritical. The following story is about VPN service providers leaving India as the Indian government forces them to record your data, which a VPN is not supposed to do. Next, Youtube is nowadays forcing people a lot of ads, which makes people buy its premium. But now this situation is going out of hand. Next, Meta is always ready to fight Apple and this time, it tried to breach Apple’s app tracking transparency feature, which they did. The following and last stories are about some quick updates on Pixel 7 and 7 Pro and how Tata group is trying to take iPhone manufacturing into their space, they are talking with Wistron to do so. So, we’ll talk about all these stories. Enjoy!!
